# Bastion-Terraform
The aim of this repository is to create a Azure Bastion Host via IaC which will be sitting in front of virtual machine which is living inside a private subnet.

Terraform module will be used to create the infrastructure. 
I will show a possible way to SSH into a virtual machine which does not have public IP address assigned to it. 

I will show also how to securely copy files through the Bastion Host to the virtual machine using SCP command.
